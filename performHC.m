%==========================================================================
% FUNCTION: d = stod(S)
% DESCRIPTION: This function converts similarity values to distance values
%              and change matrix's format from square to vector (input
%              format for linkage function)
%
% INPUTS:   S = N-by-N similarity matrix
%
% OUTPUT:   d = a distance vector
